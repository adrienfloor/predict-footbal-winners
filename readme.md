"In this video, we'll use machine learning to predict who will win football matches in the EPL. We'll start by cleaning the EPL match data we scraped in the last video. We'll create predictors and train a machine learning model to predict the winner of each of the football matches. Then we'll end by measuring error and making improvements."
